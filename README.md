This is a simple command-line-based Tic Tac Toe game. Two players alternate taking turns placing their markers on a
3-by-3 board. The program serves as a digital alternative to a physical board: it keeps track of where the players have
placed their markers, but it is up to the players to play fairly and recognize a winner if there is one.

To run the program, simply type `make && make run` into the command line, press enter, and follow the instructions on
screen. To clean up the files that the game produces, run `make clean`.

Have fun!
